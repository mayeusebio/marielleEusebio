Hi! I'm Marielle Eusebio, a senior Electrical Engineering student at the University of California, Davis.

Recently I've been exposed to a lot of different facets of electrical engineering such as robotics and embedded systems, some of which I'd like to share here. 

I'm excited for what's to come on this site!
